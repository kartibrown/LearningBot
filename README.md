# LearningBot
This is a little project where you can learn a bot yourself to say what you want.
I've been working on it only couple of days but now everything works but there are some functionalities that needs to be implemented.

I've included my bot.txt. I'm gonna update it every now and then.
You can delete the bot.txt file to make the bot "forget" everything and start over.

To make the bot learn:
Learn Do you like github? Answer Yes, very much!

and the bot will answer "Yes, very much!" if you say "Do you like github?".
